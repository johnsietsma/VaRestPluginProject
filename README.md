# VaRestPluginProject

An empty Unreal Engine project for building the VaRest plugin.

Simply open the project in the Unreal Editor and it will build the plugin to Plugins/VaRest/Binaries.

Simply copy the entire /Plugins/VaRest folder into the Plugin folder of your own project to use the plugin.

VaRest is included as a submodule. Update the submodule to get a later version.
